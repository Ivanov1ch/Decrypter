# Decrypter
A GUI application that can **decode encrypted messages**, whether or not you have the key, letting you **test encryption** methods, run brute force **penetration testing** and learn more about cryptography. 

## Notice: This program is a work in progress! There is still much we plan to do to optimize the application and make the user experience more friendly
